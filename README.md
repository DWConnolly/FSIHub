Experimental Area for Danico LLC
### Executive Summary
Danico LLC is the name weâ€™ve dubbed the team of Daniel Connolly and Nicole Haley.  During the first half of 2020 we focused on securing breakthrough wins at five strategic accounts.

GEICO | 2,343

PNC Bank | 784

Citizens Financial | 23

M&T Bank | 574

Metlife | 500

These produced great momentum, and two key learnings have come during the experience:  
Bundling of enablement services at the time of sale could produce greater adoption
We need larger deals in order to retire the size of our quota

Therefore we are making a strategic pivot to create focus areas around key large wins and another area around enablement and adoption for the new logos we have secured in the first half of 2020.

**Objective: $1.3M in 1H 21**
